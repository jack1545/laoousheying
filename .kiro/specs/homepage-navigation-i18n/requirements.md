# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature addresses multiple critical issues with the photography portfolio website: missing navigation on the homepage, incomplete internationalization, missing footer component, incorrect link paths, and missing images in blog content. The homepage currently doesn't display the navigation bar or footer, making it difficult for users to navigate and providing an incomplete user experience. Additionally, while the navigation is translated, the homepage content remains entirely in Chinese, and many links use incorrect paths that don't include proper locale prefixes.
